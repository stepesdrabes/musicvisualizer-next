/**
 * Groove against drop, as softmax weights over `SECTION_FEATURES`.
 *
 * GENERATED. Do not hand-edit: the coefficients are indexed by feature ORDER, so an edit that
 * looks local is a different model. The fitter that produced them is no longer in the tree, so
 * changing `SECTION_FEATURES` means writing a new one and refitting, not adjusting numbers here.
 *
 * Fitted on 115 Harmonix tracks annotated with musical function. Cross-validated five ways
 * and grouped BY TRACK, so it is scored only on tracks the fit never saw: it calls this decision
 * right on 69.1% of annotated frames, against 46.2% for always answering the commoner of
 * the two. The hand-written thresholds it replaces reached F1 47.2 on groove and 53.6 on drop
 * where a fit on the same features reaches 62.0 and 67.2.
 *
 * This is the only label a model decides here. Build, breakdown, void, intro and outro keep their
 * rules, and the rules win on them: the build walk-back scores 15.3 F1 against a model's 0.0,
 * because a build is defined by where it is GOING and no summary of what a section contains can
 * see that.
