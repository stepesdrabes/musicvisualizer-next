/**
 * The room breathing on the phrase, for a passage with no drums to answer.
 *
 * Everything else in the catalog that moves takes its timing from a hit. In an intro there are
 * no hits, which is why those passages sat still: the grid was right there in the frame and
 * nothing was reading it. This reads only the grid and the spectrum, so it works on a solo
 * piano and on a pad, and it fills the room rather than drawing a shape on it.
 *
 * A slow swell across the phrase with a lift on each bar inside it, so the room has both the
 * long shape and the count. Nothing here is a flash: the fastest thing it does takes a beat.
