 * Three bands of the mix, three overlapping fields, the whole room.
 *
 * Written as a second layer that is genuinely a layer. Most accents in the catalog are stamps
 * and sparks with almost nothing behind them, which is fine over a full drop stack and leaves a
 * two-layer intro cue lit by one and a half. This covers the room and still says something the
 * bed does not: where the weight of the mix is sitting, as it moves.
 *
 * Each lobe is its own meter, so the three answer different instruments. The low lobe swells on
 * the riff, the top lobe answers the hats, and because they overlap everywhere the room stays
 * covered while its colour balance moves. That balance is the reaction: a passage that is all
 * bottom end sits in the base colour, and one that opens up at the top pulls toward the third.
