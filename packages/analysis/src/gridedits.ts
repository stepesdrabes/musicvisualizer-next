 * two different phases of the same uniform grid, and meterConfidence 0.52 was the
 * pipeline noticing without being able to say what it saw. The grid absorbs each edit
 * as one SHORT bar ending at the cut, so every mark lands on a bar line and pre-arrival
 * gestures keep their true length - never a long bar, which stretches whatever gesture
 * lands in it (the staged strobe led its slam by six real beats).
 *
 * The cuts come from the listener - a hand-drawn section map's off-grid boundaries, or
 * moments heard directly. An automatic plateau detector over per-bar onset phases was
 * built, measured against the one track with verified edits, and killed the same
 * evening: a backbeat is symmetric under a half-bar shift, so the broadband vote
 * carries no signal (the phase-0 truth region of Safir voted 0/0/5/2), and the
 * detector's one real act was hallucinating an edit on a praised sentinel. The
 * postmortem lives in the round record; an automatic form may return only with an
 * asymmetric voter, behind the same instruments that killed this one.

 * uniform grid carries residue 0 everywhere and implies nothing; Safir's map carries
 * 0, 2, 2, 0 and implies exactly the two cuts the owner confirmed by ear.
 *
 * A residue change counts only when the NEXT boundary carries it too. An inserted half bar
 * shifts everything after it, so real evidence always comes in twos; a lone change is a
 * drag, because the editor snaps to BEATS and a nudge onto a mid-bar beat is expressible
 * without meaning anything about meter. Blinding Lights' outro is one such nudge - one
 * boundary of eleven, 35 ms off a mid-bar beat - and it was cutting that track's grid.
 * The cost of the rule is an edit evidenced only by a map's final boundary, which no
 * following boundary can corroborate; that one has to come in as `gridCuts` directly.
 *
 * The residue walk only means anything on a UNIFORM drawing surface - see `handMapGrid`,
 * which is what callers with a map should use.

/**
 * What a hand-drawn map says about the GRID, given the analysis it was drawn on.
 *
 * On a uniform drawing surface the map's own residues are the evidence, and the cuts come
 * from `deriveGridCuts`. On a surface that is ALREADY piecewise they are not: the map's
 * boundaries carry positions from a grid whose bar lines have moved, so measuring them
 * against a uniform walk invents cuts. Safir's map, drawn on its confirmed two-cut grid,
 * derives 54.20 / 67.40 / 106.80 that way where the grid it was drawn on needs 53.80 and
 * 106.80 - the next version bump would have re-cut a grid the room had already confirmed.
 *
 * So a piecewise surface is carried forward as-is. Nor is the map allowed to add cuts to
 * one: its boundaries are dragged onto a BEAT grid, which makes a one-beat nudge (Safir's
 * verse sits a beat past its bar line) indistinguishable from a metrical edit. A new cut
 * on an already-cut track has to come from the listener directly, as `gridCuts`.
