/**
 * Volume changes LENGTH, not brightness - that is the difference between a meter and a
 * wall that pulses. Falling peak dots under gravity make it legible as a measurement.
 *
 * Every strip owns a different slice of the spectrum, so the room is an analyser rather than a
 * row of identical meters. It used to drive all of them off the same three numbers and tell
 * them apart with a hashed bias, which looks like variety and measures nothing.
 *
 * A meter is only a meter while it has somewhere to go. This spent a long time pinned: the
 * drive summed a kick envelope onto two band levels that are already near 1.0 in any loud
 * passage, multiplied the total by a gain of up to 1.55, and clamped. Every strip read full
 * scale, every bar filled its whole strip, and the room became the flat bright wall the first
 * line here says it must not be - measured on a drop, 144 of the stack's 198 bytes and the
 * least movement of the four layers in it. The signal now has to reach full scale on its own
 * merits, and the headroom that leaves is what the differences between strips are drawn in.
