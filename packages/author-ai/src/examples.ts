/**
 * Two effects in the dialect a generated one is written in.
 *
 * The DSL reference is a list of signatures, which says what exists and nothing about how any of
 * it goes together. These are the two shapes almost every effect is one of - a field that writes
 * every pixel every frame, and a trail that decays its own buffer - and between them they carry
 * the rules that are easiest to get wrong: latch anything the music drives, keep a spectral term
 * inside base..glow, never clear a buffer you are decaying, pass lo/hi when stamping into the
 * global one.
 *
 * Both are compiled and measured by `examples.test.ts`, so an example that would be rejected by
 * the gate cannot be shipped to the model as one that would not.
