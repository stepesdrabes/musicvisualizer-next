 * effect wired straight to it shimmers. `BeatHold` removes that by sampling once a beat, which
 * also removes every guitar stab, cymbal and word that happens between beats - most of what
 * makes a room look like it is listening.
 *
 * An attack in the tens of milliseconds is under the eye's integration window, so a transient
 * arrives looking instant while noise, which alternates sign every frame or two, is averaged
 * away. The longer release is what stops the room strobing on the back of every note: the eye
 * forgives a slow decay and objects loudly to a fast one.
 *
 * Defaults are a compromise picked for level: 25 ms up reads as immediate, 140 ms down is about
 * a sixteenth at 110 bpm, so a chord rings out rather than snapping off. Pass a longer attack
 * for a position, which should never teleport, and a shorter one for a meter tip.

 * Whether an instrument is CURRENTLY PLAYING, read off its hit envelope: 1.0 while hits keep

 *
 * For the grid-locked pulse effects. A pulse on the beat grid is in the groove rather than
 * reacting to it - that is its point - but it also keeps pounding through the bars where the
 * producer pulled the kick out, and a room that slams over a suspension is a room that is not
 * listening. Scaling each pulse by this restores the arrangement without costing the grid:
 * timing stays the grid's, only the permission to strike follows the kit.
 *
 * The hold is in beats because gaps are musical: four-on-the-floor rests for one beat, a
 * syncopated pattern for two or three, so a hold of a bar keeps every real pattern at full
 * while an eight-bar suspension fades inside two. Rises to the envelope's own peak rather
 * than to 1.0, so a lone ghost note arms a ghost of a pulse, not a full slam.
