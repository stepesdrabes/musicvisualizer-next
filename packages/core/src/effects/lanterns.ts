/**
 * Soft pools of light that wander the perimeter and settle, the way lamps sit round a bar.
 *
 * Each has its own wander period, its own breathing period and its own place on the palette, all
 * hashed from its index, so no two are ever in step and a seek reproduces every one of them. The
 * periods are deliberately not related by a whole number: five lamps on a common clock is a chase.
 *
 * Sparse by design, so it declares `carries: false` and always rides a bed. The beam takes the mean
 * of the lamps as an even spill rather than a sixth pool, because the ceiling is where a room's
 * light bounces and not where a lamp stands.
