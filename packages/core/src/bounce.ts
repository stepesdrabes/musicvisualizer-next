/**
 * Level this fixture holds while a show is running, as a fraction of the light it can make.
 *
 * The one thing that makes a light distracting is going fully dark and coming back: a fixture
 * breathing between a fifth and full reads as alive, and the same fixture between nothing and
 * full reads as a fault. It matters more here than on the frame, because a lamp standing in a
 * corner sits in peripheral vision whenever the room is what is being looked at, and the
 * periphery is markedly more flicker-sensitive than the fovea.
 *
 * It costs range, and that is why it is not higher. Against the measured section table it turns
 * a room running 0.28 at an intro and 0.90 at a drop into a lamp running 0.37 and 0.91, so the
 * show's 3.2:1 between them arrives as 2.5:1.
 *
 * **In light, not in the authoring domain**, which is where the number was measured: the board it
 * came from wrote PWM duty directly. Set as an authoring value it would go through `quantize` a
 * second time and land at 1% of the light it names, which is a lamp that reads as off.

 * that keeps catching your eye: the hit reads as a shimmer over a steady wash instead of the

/**
 * The Bounce Lamp: the show's accent hue, pulsed on the kit.
 *
 * A one-pixel fixture. It carries colour, level and timing, and nothing a show says by moving
 * light across a room - so it is derived from the frame rather than painted by an effect, and
 * nothing in the catalog has to know it exists.
 *
 * The two envelopes are the design the firmware's analog lamp was built around and measured. The
 * one thing that changes by computing them here is where the beat comes from: a percentile taken
 * over the whole fixture barely moves per kick, because one hit lights a small share of a big
 * frame, so the board could only ever infer the beat. `kickEnv` is the beat, exactly.
 *
 * Colour is not eased. The board had to, because it read hue from a mean of the room that moved
 * whenever anything in the room did; a palette slot only changes when the room's own colour
 * changes, and easing the lamp alone would leave it lagging the walls through every cue.
 *
 * Everything about the level happens in **light** rather than in the authoring domain, because
 * that is the domain every constant here was measured in and the domain the eye reads. The one
 * conversion back sits on the last line.
