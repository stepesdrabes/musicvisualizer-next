 * linter reads that column as well - so replacing only the span table produced cues written
 * for the new arrangement running against effects that still saw the old one. That is what
 * made the preview look inert in the room. `moments` follows for the same reason.

 * different". A boundary placed off the grid is a statement ABOUT the grid, and the analysis
 * already knows how to answer it: the listener cut, which absorbs the offset as one short bar
 * ending exactly at the mark. This does the same thing to the cached table so the preview
 * shows what the next analysis will produce, rather than a rounded stand-in for it.
