//! Letting the webview draw as fast as the display can.
//!
//! WKWebView paces `requestAnimationFrame` at 60 Hz whatever the panel is capable of, which on a
//! ProMotion Mac is half of what the room could be shown at. Safari does not, because the setting
//! that governs it - `PreferPageRenderingUpdatesNear60FPSEnabled` - is honoured for Safari and not
//! for an embedded webview. WebKit bug 294338 has been open on exactly that since June 2025, and
//! no public API exposes the preference. The only route is the one Safari itself uses.
//!
//! So this is a private API, deliberately: `+[WKPreferences _features]` for the catalogue and
//! `-[WKPreferences _setEnabled:forFeature:]` to spend it. It matters less here than it would
//! elsewhere - the app is unsigned and runs on the machine that built it, so there is no review to
//! fail - but it is still a selector Apple never promised. Every call is guarded, and if any of
//! them ever goes away the room draws at 60 again, which is what it did before this existed.
//!
//! The catalogue is a CLASS method while the setter is an instance one, and that asymmetry is the
//! whole trap: asking the preferences object whether it responds to `_features` says no, which
//! reads exactly like a feature that has been withdrawn. It has not - there are 579 of them on
//! macOS 26.3, and this is one.
