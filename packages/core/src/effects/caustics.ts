/**
 * Light refracted off moving water.
 *
 * The filaments are the zero set of the difference between two drifting noise fields, not a
 * threshold on one of them. A threshold gives clouds: wide bright regions with wide dark ones
 * between. Water gives the opposite - thin bright lines over a lot of dark - and that ratio is the
 * whole difference between the two looks.
 *
 * The lines ride over a dim wash rather than over black, because a real pool lights its room as
 * well as its ceiling, and because a bed is what a quiet cue has instead of a room.
