/**
 * A synthesised arrangement with an exact grid, for the tests in this package.
 *
 * Shared rather than copied into each test file: the planner, the linter and the measurement
 * all have to agree about the same track, and three fixtures that drift apart would let two of
 * them pass against a third's idea of the arrangement.
 *
 * Boundaries sit on the 4-bar grid because the analyser guarantees that, and the engine reads
 * it as given. The void is the one exception: it is phrase-terminal, so it starts wherever the
 * silence does and it is the drop after it that has to land on the grid.
