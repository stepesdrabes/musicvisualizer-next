/**
 * The anthem floor: the whole room held high and saturated, one broad crest of light
 * making a slow lap of the perimeter, a soft swell answering every downbeat.
 *
 * Written for choruses and nothing else - the point is a floor that reads as "the song is
 * here now", which a warehouse drop neither needs nor earns. Big and simple where
 * `chorusBloom` is articulate: that one answers six bands with six petals, this one answers
 * the mix with its whole body, and the pair being different is what gives the seed a choice.
