 * Phase-spread brightness with the crests tinted - the most restrained motion layer, and the
 * right default when the groove should feel liquid rather than punchy.
 *
 * Restrained is not the same as monochrome. The troughs hold the room's own colour and only the
 * crests reach for a second one, by as much as the mix has opened up: the wave is then legible
 * as a wave rather than as one hue getting brighter, and the show's other hue is spent on a
 * sixth of the room rather than all of it.
