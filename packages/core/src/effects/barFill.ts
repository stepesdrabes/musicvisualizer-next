/**
 * Five bars filling toward the drop, one per strip.
 *
 * `meterBuild` fills the perimeter as a single continuous line, which reads as one long meter
 * lapping the room. This is the other reading of the same idea and the one the room is actually
 * built for: each strip is its own bar, so a build looks like five columns charging rather than a
 * dot travelling. The strips are staggered so they arrive in sequence and the last one lands on
 * the drop, which is what stops five identical bars reading as one wide one.
 *
 * The ceiling beam fills last on purpose. It is the only strip an occupant sees without turning
 * their head, so giving it the final quarter puts the arrival where it cannot be missed.
