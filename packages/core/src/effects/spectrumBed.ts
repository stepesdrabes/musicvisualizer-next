/**
 * The room laid out low to high, following the spectrum as it actually moves.
 *
 * Each tap is a meter for its own slice of the range: the bass end answers the riff, the top
 * end answers the cymbals, and the two do it independently, which is what makes the room read
 * as an arrangement rather than as one level with a shape drawn on it.
 *
 * Followed rather than latched. A beat latch was here to remove frame-rate shimmer, at the cost
 * of every stab and cymbal between beats, which in this repertoire is most of the music. The
 * shimmer turned out not to be the constraint: measured on a real track, sweeping the attack
 * from 20 ms to 120 ms moves delivered ripple by 4%, so the spectrum is not noisy at frame rate
 * and there was nothing to latch away. What the latch did produce was movement AT THE BEAT RATE,
 * which at these tempos sits inside the band a phrase-scale metric measures - so it scored well
 * on drift while looking exactly as grid-locked as it was.

/**
 * How deep the followed band cuts into the level, as a fraction either side of unity.
 *
 * Centred on unity rather than reaching down to it: a relief that only ever darkens is a dimmer,
 * and it cost this bed a third of its coverage when it was written that way. Higher reads as
 * more reactive and fills less of the room, and a bed has to keep filling one.
 *
 * 1.3 rather than the 1.4 this ran at while latched, because following the spectrum lowers the
 * mean of the same term: measured over a fixture intro, 1.3 delivers 16.4 bytes against 15.6 at
 * 1.4 and 14.9 at 1.5, and an intro two bytes lower is one that crosses into being reported dark
 * while it fades. What the depth buys is contrast, which is not what this pass was for.
