 * settled against. Not much dimmer, though. Gamma 2.2 means a level of 0.72 arrives as 48% of the

 * Firelight, on the room's own clock rather than the music's.

 * Three noise fields at three rates multiplied together, which is what stops a flicker having an
 * audible period: the body wanders over about half a minute, the flame moves at a second or so,
 * and the sputter is fast and shallow. Any one of them alone reads as a pattern.
 *
 * The slot only ever walks `deep` to `glow`. That stretch of the ramp is one hue at three
 * lightnesses, which is exactly what fire is, and crossing past `white` toward the accent would
 * make the flame change colour rather than brightness.
