/**
 * A sky, laid across the room rather than up it.
 *
 * Every LED in this fixture is at the same height - the frame is one plane at 2.4 m -
 * so there is no vertical axis to put a horizon on. What there is is a horizontal plane, and a
 * sunset seen from inside a room is a horizontal thing anyway: one side glows, the far side has
 * already gone blue, and the bearing walks round as the sun goes down.
 *
 * So the glow is a wide lobe on a world-space axis that turns about once every seven minutes, over
 * an even wash that never lets the far side reach black. The turn is the only thing here that
 * varies colour over time, and seven minutes is slow enough to be allowed to.
