/**
 * Deliberately dull, on a 30-60 s period: silence should look like the room resting, not like
 * the analyser chewing on the noise floor.
 *
 * Deaf to level, and not deaf to the music. `listen` puts the spectrum on where the gradient sits
 * and how far up the palette it reaches, and lays the bands themselves across the room as a
 * shallow relief, which is what an intro under a lone pad needs: nothing here answers a hit, but
 * the room shows what is playing rather than holding one frame for a minute. Set it to zero for
 * the old idle wash.
 *
 * The relief is why the two aggregate readings above are not enough on their own. In a sparse
 * intro most bands are silent - measured on one, 59% of the spectrum sat under 0.02 - so a tilt
 * and a focus computed across all of them barely move, while the handful of bands actually
 * carrying the passage vary plenty. Reading them where they are is the difference between a room
 * that looks asleep and one that looks quiet.
