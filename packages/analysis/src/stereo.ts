 * This is the one thing a mono downmix destroys rather than blurs, and it is the whole point
 * of the trick this exists for: a chopped vocal thrown hard left and right on every sixteenth
 * is the most recognisable gesture in the genre, and it is invisible to every other feature
 * here because the sum of the two channels does not move at all.
 *
 * Measured over 200 Hz to 6 kHz. Below that a mix is mono by convention, because the bass
 * would otherwise pull a cutting lathe or a club rig off centre; above it, cymbals are wide
 * on nearly every record and would swamp what the vocal is doing.
