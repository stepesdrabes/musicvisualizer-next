# Effect polishing

How a listening complaint becomes a shipped fix, and the rules this repo has already paid
for. First written after the 2026-08-12 pass that fixed seven complaints in one sweep;
rewritten after the first judged rounds, which changed the method: the owner now judges in
the app, and the judgements are the instrument everything else is tuned against.

## The judge loop is the method

The app has a judge mode: `J` opens the panel, stars and a fixed chip vocabulary score the
track, `N` drops a time-anchored note at the playhead ("bar 87: this slam came from
nowhere"). Every judgement autosaves to `<cache>/judge/<trackId>.json` pinned to the
`analysisHash` and show seed that were actually playing, so a complaint about a
since-recomposed show is history rather than a bug report. Thirty judged tracks produced
three actionable clusters in one evening; the marked bars did more than any corpus metric.

Rules the first rounds established:

- **The chips aggregate, the notes diagnose.** "sections wrong" ten times says where to
  look; "@71s bar 43: chorus starts a bit early" says what to fix. Ask for both.
- **Marked bars outrank bench scores at one-bar resolution.** The boundary metrics tolerate
  half a second, which at 120 bpm is most of a bar - exactly the errors the room hears and
  the bench cannot. Fourteen user-marked bars are a better instrument for that class than
  either annotated corpus.
- **Cluster before fixing.** Three of seven complaints in one pass shared a root cause
  (nothing was kit-aware); ten of thirty shared another (one-bar boundary jitter). A
  per-complaint fix on a shared cause is work done seven times.
- **Close the loop.** After a fix lands, hand back the short list of tracks to re-judge,
  never the whole corpus. Re-listening is the expensive resource here.
- **Positive judgements are calibration.** The 5-star tracks guard against regressions and
  say what "right" reads like; ask for them explicitly.

## Diagnose from the cache, not from the code

Every complaint names a track, and the track's whole story is on disk: the desktop app's
cache in `~/Library/Application Support/cz.drabek.lightningstrike/cache`, the dev server's
in `cache/`, the judging corpus in `cache114/` - `<id>.analysis.json`, `.show.json`,
`.meta.json`, `.context.json` beside the audio. Before touching anything:

1. Find the id by grepping metas for the title; the judgement file already carries it.
2. Read the analysis against the complaint: per-section kick/snare/hat densities, tempo and
   meter confidence, the events column. Most complaints are visible as numbers.
3. Read the show's cues and hits against those numbers - what the planner believed.
4. Recompose the cached analysis at HEAD and diff against the cached show. Same seed
   reproduces the same show, so `cached == fresh` proves the complaint is live; a diff
   means a stale build was judged - half of one session's "bugs" were one already-fixed bug
   that had never reached the cache.
5. For lyric questions, `chorusSpansFromLyrics` over the cached context is ground truth
   enough: on the first track checked, the hook line's synced time marked the true chorus
   bar twice while the boundary sat one and two bars off. LRCLIB line timing is reliable;
   trust it as evidence.

## Saturation is a number, and taste has a budget

The complaint "this effect is OVERUSED" arrives long after the numbers could have said so.
Measure share-of-shows per family before shipping any effect or preference change
(`bars used and shows containing, per family, over the corpus` - a twenty-line probe):

- **A signature drifts into a mandate at any weight.** The +1.1 preference put impulseSpin
  in 30 of 34 house shows; removing the preference left it at 80 percent on merit alone,
  because a mid-energy kick rhythm is near-eligible in every pool. The shipped answer is
  both halves: each show draws a seed-stable HALF of the family's signature list, and the
  undrawn half joins the avoid list at full weight for the night. A signature look is
  either this show's vocabulary or it rests. Guarded by a 60-seed band test.
- **The avoid weight must beat the jitter.** At 1.2 against 1.4 of seed jitter, moshSlam
  still opened rap choruses; at 2.4 (one use of novelty) a foreign gesture reliably loses
  the tie and stays reachable when the pool empties. Prefer and avoid are not symmetric:
  a nudge suffices toward, a shove is needed away.
- **High-salience effects saturate at the same share as subtle ones and get complained
  about first.** vortex and pump sit in ~95 percent of all shows organically and nobody
  minds; a travelling wave at 88 percent was called out immediately. Budget salience,
  not just presence.

## Archetypes, not just effects

The second complaint class was "the effects are all shockwave effects" - and the count
agreed: six of twelve transients were radial energy from a point (expanding rings,
converging rings, waves from corners, bursts). A catalog diversifies by GESTURE GEOMETRY,
not by file count. The archetype vocabulary now on the wall:

- radial burst (shockwave, kickTunnel, rippleTank, pyroBursts) - the incumbent family
- spring displacement - the field itself shoved and returning (recoil; the owner rejected it on sight - whole-field displacement reads as the room glitching, spend displacement on a local element instead)
- directional travel with reflection - a shot, not a wave (ricochet)
- linear stroke - one wall, one line, one direction (snareBlade)
- structural give - architecture taking weight (counterweight)
- interference - two slow fields making a fast-feeling pattern (weave)
- freeze - motion withheld as the gesture (stopTime)
- exact-arrival wipes only a compiled show can do (buildStacker; timedSweep was the same idea as a fill-and-drain wipe and the owner rejected it - an exact arrival earns its place only when the shape between arrivals is worth watching)

**New effects must arrive at the incumbents' energy distance or they change nothing.** The
five newcomers first shipped at e2-3 against incumbent bursts at e4-5, scored 4-8 shows per
family, and moved no needle: the -1.6/band energy fit priced them out of the exact cues
the bursts saturate. Repriced to e3-4 they compete everywhere (28-32 of 36 hip-hop shows)
and the burst share fell without a single veto. This is the third time the catalog-pairs
lesson has been paid for; it is apparently the tuition this repo keeps owing.

## The kit is a fact, not a vibe

`BarRow.kicks/snares/hats` and the onset streams are measurements. The rules built on them:

- An effect whose whole gesture answers one drum declares `taste.kit`; the picker refuses
  it where that stream runs under 0.2 hits/beat over the slot. The veto falls back to the
  unfiltered pool rather than emptying one - filters guarantee absence, preferences
  guarantee presence, and a hard requirement that can empty a pool is a mistake made twice
  already.
- Tag by what the gesture IS: moshSlam and headbang are `kick` because a unison slam is a
  kick gesture, whatever band tripped the detector.
- Grid-locked pulsers keep timing from the grid and take PERMISSION from a `Presence` of
  the hit envelope: full through a pattern's own gaps, resting within a couple of bars of
  real silence, rising only to the envelope's own peak.
- Punctuation obeys the same honesty: a drop arrival with no kick in its bar gets a colour
  bump, not a slam.
- The wildcard's freedom is from the SECTION vocabulary only. It still respects the kit
  veto and never lands a flash or impact effect - a strobe as the one surprise in a rap
  verse was how "surprise" read as fault.

## Hits must survive the cue boundary

The player consumes onsets up to ~30 ms EARLY on purpose (anticipation: early light reads
tighter than late). That lead means a kick sitting exactly on a cue boundary fires its
one-frame edge into the OUTGOING effect; the incoming one - installed precisely to answer
it - heard silence. The player now re-asserts any edge younger than the lead plus a frame
on the install frame. The general law: any consume-once event plus any deferred consumer
is this bug; when adding either, ask who else needed the event.

## Aggression comes from the record, not the genre card

- A bloom-family drop that measurably pounds (>= 0.8 kicks/beat) takes slam treatment for
  its punctuation - per slot, not only at the peak. The peak-only version fixed Galantis;
  a listening note then missed the strobe on the FIRST drop of a pounding house track.
  Same evidence, same answer, anywhere it occurs.
- Swell families are never overridden; their peak is a rise by definition.
- Genre remaps are the last resort; the aggression override fixes the track that is
  playing without moving every other track in the drawer.

## Builds, rates and fades

- buildStrobe fires only from buildProgress 0.45: two listening notes on two tracks said
  the same thing, a sixteen-bar riser flashing from its first bar is half a minute of
  strobe. The roll is the END of a build; the front half belongs to the layers that climb.
- The strobe rate ceiling is `strobePerBeat` under `STROBE_MAX_HZ = 8`, one function
  imported by the planner AND the linter - two implementations of one allowance is how
  they disagree (the `hitSeconds` lesson).
- Quiet-to-quiet seams (intro/breakdown/outro into anything short of a drop) fade over 12
  beats. Both sides are near-still, so the change IS the event, and at two bars it read
  as a jump twice in one judging round.

## Param semantics are contracts

`paramsFor` writes values into any effect declaring a matching key, so the KEY is a
contract about units: `perBeat` is a rate, `cycleBeats` is a period, and reusing one for
the other ran sineRoll at four times its speed on every sparse track. Felt sizes derive
from the MEDIAN tempo once at compose. Grid-locked phase comes off the absolute bar clock
and is never multiplied by `ctx.motion`; integrated state (springs, momentum) may scale
its timestep by motion because pausing genuinely parks it.

## Trust the analysis to distrust itself

`gridTrust` trips on fragmentation - over 5.2 sections a minute, or over 4.5 with meter
confidence at or below 0.55 or a 2/4 verdict - never on confidence alone, and now only
with at least TEN sections: fragmentation needs fragments. A 95-second hardstyle edit with
a normal eight-section arrangement reads as 5.1 a minute, which routed a correctly
labelled track to lounge; rate-based gates are biased against short tracks. Calibrate on
the real corpus, price the false positive honestly (a good show replaced by lounge costs
more than a bad one let through), and keep the owner's override in the meta.

## Version discipline, or fixes never arrive

- Analyser changes bump `ANALYSIS_VERSION`, engine changes bump `SHOW_VERSION`, every
  session, no exceptions. Everything re-derives lazily per track.
- `prepare()` keeps a show only when hash matches AND versions are current AND the
  analysis came from cache; model-authored shows are exempt.
- The app build must be at least as new as the artifacts handed to it, or the old build
  re-analyses the future back down. The full loop that works: quit app, rebundle, rebuild,
  install, sync artifacts, relaunch, then curl its own `/api/library` and read the
  `current` count - the app's opinion, not the repo's.

## Prove it before claiming it

Unit tests per rule first, and **verify a new regression test fails against the bug it
was written for** - the kick-on-switch test was flipped off and on to prove both
directions. Then recompose the named tracks and diff cues/hits; then a scratch-copy
re-analysis (`MV_CACHE_DIR` + `bench/reanalyse.ts`) so no live cache is mutated during
validation; then `bench/showprobe.ts` for the gate that never moves: **0 lint errors,
0 misfires, 100 percent quiet coverage**. Measure saturation per family after any picker
or catalog change. The engine-never-fails-its-own-linter sweep stays the cheapest
high-yield test in the suite.

A fix that cannot be seen in a recomposed cue list, a hit diff, a probe number or a
re-judged track is not finished; it is intended.
