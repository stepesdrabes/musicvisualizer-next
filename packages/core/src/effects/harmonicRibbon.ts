/**
 * A band of light that follows whatever is carrying the tune.
 *
 * The spectral centroid says where the energy is sitting and `spectrumFocus` says whether that
 * is one voice or a whole arrangement. Together they draw a line that walks with a vocal or a
 * lead and spreads into a wash when the mix fills out, which is a melody in the room - the one
 * thing a drum-driven catalog could never show.
 *
 * It carries, and it means it: a quiet cue whose second layer is this is genuinely two layers,
 * where the same cue behind a sparkle was one and a rumour.
