/**
 * The duck is the groove: the gap a kick carves out of everything else is what an ear hears as
 * the pump, so this is one gesture the whole room shares.
 *
 * It arrives across the room rather than everywhere at once. A sidechain in a physical space
 * reaches the far wall after the near one, and the room is five metres deep; without the lag
 * this filled 83% of the room with one flat level and one flat hue, which is a layer that
 * swamps everything mixed under it while saying less than any of them.
