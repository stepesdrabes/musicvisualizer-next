/**
 * Two bars in, two bars out, across the whole room.
 *
 * The quietest thing here that is still doing something, and the one to reach for when a
 * passage should feel held rather than lit. It takes its period from the bar table, so it
 * breathes with the song at any tempo and stays in phase with it across a track that drifts.
 *
 * The spectrum never GATES it: an outro where the last note has decayed should still show the
 * room breathing, or the track ends by looking switched off. What it does do is ride on top,
 * as articulation above the swell rather than as a multiplier into it. An intro with a riff in
 * it was being lit by nothing but the bar table, which is a metronome with the room attached.
