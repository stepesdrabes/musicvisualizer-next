 * measured at 90 (chartreuse) came out of the room at 60 (yellow). Anything that measures a hue
 * from the outside world - artwork, a published colour, a user's pick - is in textbook degrees and
 * has to come through here before it can be a palette hue.
 *
 * Inverted by search rather than algebraically because the ramp is piecewise and not injective:
 * it spends no coordinates at all between about 150 and 223 degrees, which is cyan, so a cyan
 * sleeve resolves to the nearest hue the LEDs can actually make instead of to nothing.
