/**
 * A drifting field whose grain is set by how busy the arrangement is.
 *
 * One voice on its own leaves the room smooth and slow; a full mix breaks it into finer, faster
 * cells. That is a texture reading the ARRANGEMENT rather than the level, which is what a
 * passage with no percussion has to be lit by, and it fills the whole room while doing it.
 *
 * The colour walks between the base and the third hue on the bottom-to-top balance of the mix,
 * so a bassline entering is a change of colour as well as of brightness.
