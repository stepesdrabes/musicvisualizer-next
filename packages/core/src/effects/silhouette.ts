/**
 * Figure/ground reversal, held: the ring blazes while the centre beam goes dark, so the
 * room's middle reads as a silhouette against its own edge. The documented rap-climax
 * look (Saint Pablo's figure against red fog, Stormzy's sculptural key light), and the
 * catalog's second "maximum by subtraction" after stopTime - that one withholds motion,
 * this one withholds the middle of the room.
 *
 * Deliberately static: the practice literature has the peak arriving as a discontinuity
 * in COVERAGE and COLOUR, never as acceleration. The only things that move are the
 * edge's level breathing with the record and a filament push toward white on each kick.
